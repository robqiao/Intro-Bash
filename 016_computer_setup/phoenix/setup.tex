\section{Computer Setup}
\begin{information}
We will all be working on \texttt{Phoenix} directly, which is the University of Adelaide's High Performance Computing (HPC) system.
The software client \texttt{Bitvise} or \texttt{putty} which you will have already installed, enables us to access these machines in a familiar Desktop style, even though the majority of our time will be spent within the terminal. \\
\end{information}

\begin{warning}
In case you need to install Bitvise, download the installer from here: 
\href{https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download}{Bitvise SSH Client}
\end{warning}

You will need to open a SSH session to \texttt{phoenix}.
First, we need to create a session with the basic parameters
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Hostname phoenix.adelaide.edu.au
	\item Username your student or staff ID
\end{enumerate}

Now we have created the session, you will be asked for your password. \\

\begin{note}
Now that you are connected, you will notice we are now in the head node of \texttt{Phoenix}. \\
Welcome to \texttt{Phoenix}.
\end{note}
